# GirlHacks2024
## Inspiration
Our inspiration was: 
- To let users fully immerse themselves in the 70s era through a blend of educational quizzes, outfit inspiration, and interactive features
- Challenging ourselves creatively while designing a fun and engaging experience

## What it does
Our website:
- Allows users to experience the essence of 70s culture through a dress-up simulator and themed quizzes.
- Provides outfit inspiration, educational trivia, and a glimpse into the music and fashion of the disco era.

## How we built it
Are pages were built using the following:
- Paint.net to edit the clothes used on our diva.
- Use of HTML to create our website pages and CSS to style them
- Use of JavaScript to display the quiz questions and created the quiz simulation

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran into were:
- Attempting to use the Eventbrite API to display disco-related events in the user’s area. Unfortunately, the search feature was unavailable, and filtering events by location didn't work as expected.
- Some visual features, like an index card flip, were attempted for the quiz but it was quite diffucilf to integrate then seamlessly 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Accomplishments that we are proud of:
- Creating a working dress up simulator
- Creating a working webpage in 24 hours
- Learning more about using API's despite it not working

## What we learned
- It is possible to use JavaScript for animating your webpage
- It is possible to apply music to the background of an HTML page.
- API integration can come with unexpected challenges, but it's a valuable learning experience in understanding limitations and workarounds.

## What's next for Glitz and Glam: Music, Fashion, Culture
- Our next step is to successfully integrate an API that can pull live disco events, making the website more interactive and relevant for users.
- We plan to enhance the visual features, such as the index card flip effect for quiz questions, to improve the user experience.
- We’ll also resolve the issue with background music, ensuring it plays seamlessly and enhances the 70s ambiance.
